Brief Experimental Design: 
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) was knocked down in H9c2 cells using lentiviral shRNA. 
Cells were also transduced with a scrambled shRNA for controls. 
Cells were labelled with 13C16 palmitate by treating with media containing DMEM with 2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 
1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 150 microM 13C16 palmitate complexed to bovine serum albumin for 18 h after which they were placed in ‘starvation media’ (low glucose (5.5 mM) DMEM) 
for 3 h with cells collected every hour. Parallel experiments were performed with 150 M unlabelled palmitate. 
Cells were labelled with 13C6 glucose by incubating in 150 microM palmitate followed by incubation in unlabelled ‘starvation media’ for 2 h, 
then replacing glucose in the starvation media with 5.5 mM of 13C6 glucose for 1 h. 
Parallel experiments were performed by treating cells with palmitate and incubating in regular ‘starvation media’ for 3 h. 
After labelling, cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), scraped on ice, centrifuged at max speed at 4 °C for 5 mins, and pellet stored at -80 °C.
